    <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
      <p>Many of my readers know that I have been highly critical of NEO. This has brought me the ire of NEO’s community. However, I’m not going to stop warning the larger cryptocurrency community of questionable projects because this is how we grow together and this is how a legitimate industry is built.</p>

<p>As I continue to research NEO and follow its community, I continue to find more and more red flags surrounding this multi-billion dollar project. In a previous post, I talked about how NEO was <a href="http://storeofvalueblog.com/posts/major-neo-redflags/">incredibly centralized</a>, that the network had an alarmingly small number of smart contracts, and that there was no Eastern interest even though a rumour kept getting propagated that NEO is compliant with the Chinese government and has its support.</p>

<p>Now, as more and more ICOs start to be conducted on NEO, I’m seeing a serious divergence between the platform’s advertised performance and its actual performance. Da Hongfei, NEO’s cofounder, has claimed that NEO is able to support 1000 transactions per second. However, if you follow the community closely, you’ll realise that this claim is quite dubious. Whenever an ICO is run on NEO, you will see complaint after complaint of the network being down or wallets not working. This is not characteristic of a blockchain capable of 1000 transactions per second.</p>

<p><img class="-center" style="width: 100%" src="https://i.imgur.com/OkikZmH.jpg" /></p>

<p>It’s also been increasingly evident that NEO’s smart contract infrastructure has issues as well. Many developers that have tried to build on NEO have encountered heaps of problems with the system. To make matters worse, NEO forces developers to pay tens of thousands of dollars simply to deploy a smart contract.</p>

<p>In this article, I’ve compiled a series of social media comments from NEO’s community lamenting its problems. Don’t take my word on how problematic NEO is, here’s what its own investors are saying about NEO.</p>

<h1 id="single-icos-are-bringing-neos-network-to-a-halt">Single ICOs are bringing NEO’s network to a halt</h1>

<p>NEO has experienced major outages during ICOs. It’s interesting to note that NEO has so far hosted at most one concurrent ICO on its platform and still, its network is not able to handle the load. For a centralized platform that is supposedly capable of running 1000 transactions/second, not being able to handle load from a single ICO is very very surprising.</p>

<p>Here are a few ICOs that have caused significant network outages on NEO recently.</p>

<h2 id="trinity-network-credit">Trinity Network Credit</h2>

<p>During Trinity’s ICO, NEO’s network went down for almost half an hour. The popular NEON wallet by the City of Zion also stopped working and users were not able to send transactions, claim gas, or sync their balance. It also seems like the ICO was organized very poorly by the admins, with the website going down and the Telegram group filled with trolls and scammers.</p>

<hr />

<p>Blocks 1816382 and 1816382 were produced during the Trinity ICO. Notice how it took 25 minutes for NEO’s network to create block 1816382. It then took another 12 minutes to create block 1816383. The network resumed normal operation after block 1816383 with new blocks being created every 30 seconds or so. This is indisputable evidence that the blockchain went down during the ICO.</p>

<p><img class="-center" style="width: 100%; border: solid grey 1px" src="https://i.imgur.com/4972eQC.jpg" />
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NEO/comments/7qdjpo/40_minutes_of_trinity_ico/">https://www.reddit.com/r/NEO/comments/7qdjpo/40_minutes_of_trinity_ico/</a></p>

<hr />

<p>Here’s further confirmation that the network went down. Users are also discussing a NEON wallet outage.</p>

<p><img class="-center" style="width: 100%; border: solid grey 1px" src="https://i.imgur.com/KMM8wMN.jpg" />

<hr />

<p>Here’s evidence that the ICO was managed poorly. The admins were apparently also exhibiting very questionable behaviour calling people to send NEO even after the cap was reached.</p>

<p>Like Trinity, TheKEY’s ICO went poorly. Again, NEO’s network sputtered and the ICO itself was terribly organized.

<hr />

<p>I found this post by a member of NEO’s team incredibly interesting. It seems like NEO cannot afford to maintain scalable infrastructure to support the blockchain. Even worse, it seems like they can’t even muster up the funds to hire protocol developers. I have not seen a single cryptocurrency team ask its community to help pay for protocol developers.</p>

<h1 id="people-have-problems-building-neo-smart-contracts">People have problems building NEO smart contracts</h1>

<p>It’s becoming increasingly evident that smart contract developers are encountering many problems developing on NEO. Several have even accused the system of being poorly coded. To make matters worse, NEO’s team has imposed a tremendous financial barrier to deploying smart contracts. The fee to deploy a smart contract is 500 GAS, which is more than $15,000 at the current price of GAS. These problems explain why there are so few smart contracts on NEO, and why the rate of growth of NEO smart contracts is so anemic.</p>

<p>The head developer of a popular Ethereum dApp, Etheremon, recalls his experience developing on NEO.</p>

<p>The NEO community’s initiative to setup a NEO Stackexchange community was recently denied on the grounds of a lack of interest.</p>

<h1 id="summary">Summary</h1>

<p>I was one of the earliest cryptocurrency analysts to raise red flags on NEO. Now that usage of the platform has increased with more attention on the project, its problems are becoming more and more evident. The number of unexplained network outages is rising and more and more smart contract developers are being turned away from developing on NEO.</p>

<p>Guys, be careful out there. Please invest wisely.</p>

        <p>In July 2010, one bitcoin was worth $0.08 USD. Today, one bitcoin is worth $2500 USD. Bitcoin's meteoric growth has pushed cryptocurrencies from an obscure niche to the mainstream, and created fortunes along the way. Store Of Value is a blog that will help you navigate the cryptocurrency world. As an avid crypto researcher and a crypto day-trader, I hope to keep you up-to-date with the technology and help identify market opportunities. In this way, I hope that you too, can benefit from crypto.
